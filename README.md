# SN-Spring-repo

This is where I am going to build my app, a Sports Events Scheduling App. This is an app that should allow people in a certain community to view , and be part of on going Events, particularly shports events and social gatherings. You will be able to create events and set a location, then participants can register to your event when they see it in the Event Dashboard

### What is the PlayConn App?
The PlayConn app is a feed based app for people who want to figure out what sport events are currently taking place within their community. We can also call this an event scheduler depending on the specific reason a user is logged on the app because the main tasks of this app are to either view events, or create events. From the feed dashboard a user will then be able to sign-up into sport events or simply view the already signed up participants of the sports. From the event creation dashboard there will be templates that make it easier to schedule and plan an event. The goal of this app is to promote leisure sports by automating the process of scheduling such events therefore making it easier and known within a community.

### Why PlayConn App? 
The main reason why people do not always do the honors of stepping up to call out for a game is the hard effort required to do so. Some are introverts who are not too good at organizing in public, and sometimes it is just hard to let people know of what has been arranged already or to simply invite them. PlayConn will simply solve this issue by having a dashboard that lets people know of what events are taking place, and also give a user the ability to create and arrange an event from behind their screens. It is also built for people within a certain community which promotes socialness within a specific community (eg College campus). 

### Measuring Sucess
The app's success will be measured by how satisfied the users are by the reach of their events to their respective audience. Surveys can be implemented to ensure a smooth running based on feedback from users, and that can be used to further improve the app.

### Who is the Target Audience? 
The target audience are persons within a certain community such as a university campus(students and staff), who would like to connect through sport meet-ups. Being community based helps ensure safety and also promotes socialization within the community.
